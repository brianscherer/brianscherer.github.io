Welcome my personal website.

On this site I host my opinions, technical notes, and tutorial materials for whomever may stumble upon it. If you find any material useful for your scientific research please do let me know, I'd enjoy hearing about it.

I work in industry and the majority of work I did up until 2018 was published as confidential reports at GE or submitted as confidential reports to government agencies. My work that is published in scientific journals or as patents is viewable on Google Scholar.
